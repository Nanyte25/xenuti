TODO:
* Add Xenuti::Report class. Should hold info about repository, configuration options and subreports. Should be pretty-printable.
* Allow GPG-encryption of the results.
* Fix the command-line: add generate config option
* Allow generating only diff of results from latest scan
* Add sorting of results in Report. Each scanners warnings should define their own criteria for sorting.
* Accept multiple email addresses to send results to (keep compat with GPG enc)
